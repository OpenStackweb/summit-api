The increased server power requires more efficient cooling capabilities compared to traditionally used air cooling. Direct liquid cooling using cold plates can provide the needed cooling capability, as well as fit within a small volume to allow for greater server and compute density in the rack. Even though liquid cooling is not a new cooling strategy for servers, the industry is not ready to efficiently deploy liquid cooling solutions in mass. Therefore, Intel is working to enable liquid cooling ingredients with industry partners. The intent is to create more available, lower risk, and faster time to market opportunity for OEMs to deploy liquid cooling solutions. Intel\u2019s efforts are specifically focused on manifold distributed liquid cooling at the server rack level (i.e. the secondary cooling loop). The secondary loop is the fluid loop providing the cooling liquid from the Cooling Distribution Unit (CDU) through the rack manifold to the server cold plates, and then back again to the CDU through the rack manifold. The liquid cooling ingredients in the secondary loop included in Intel\u2019s enabling efforts are: cooling liquid, CDU, interchangeable Universal Quick Disconnects (UQD), cold plates, and design considerations for the secondary loop including the in-rack manifold. Intel\u2019s enabling efforts, together with Intel\u2019s strategy to enable these ingredients will be discussed in the presentation at the OCP summit. This presentation will not discuss specific internal chassis fluid loops, or cold plate designs, except for the CPU cold plate.","seats":"0","goers":"46","invite_only":"N","venue":"210 E","id":"06358d86944fdb0a3282aaf37ddd6878","venue_id":"859640","speakers":"Jessica Gullbrand, Mark Sprenger"},{"event_key":"216","active":"Y","name":"Unlocking SONiC's Potential for Intent-Based Data Centers: Three Easy Steps","event_start":"2019-03-15 14:30:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 14:55:00","event_type":"EW: SONiC","description":"Remove the barriers of deploying, monitoring and managing a data center network, while improving application reliability and availability and security -- all while lowering operating costs.

At a quick glance, a tank looks like a super huge enclosure with a bunch of semi-enclosed sleds. However, some intermediate layers in the object hierarchy are needed to signify the influences between each other. For example, we adopt the ChassisType \u201cCartridge\u201d to contain two bound sleds that cannot be plugged in to or removed from a tank independently.

In INT each network element (e.g. a SmartNIC or a Barefoot Network switch) can be programmed to insert metadata about the network state in the packet as it traverses the network. This enables visibility on all traffic (e.g. Compute, Storage\/RDMA) carried over ethernet for transient issues due to bottlenecks, failures or configuration errors. In such a solution machine learning techniques can be used to Baseline Network Performance (Path and Latency), match patterns of behavior and correlate phenomena. Such techniques can be used to promptly react to network issues or predict and anticipate problems.","seats":"0","goers":"38","invite_only":"N","venue":"Marriott Salon IV","id":"1674455a54366a59c2698696f3933b25","venue_id":"859652","speakers":"Roberto Mari"},{"event_key":"154","active":"Y","name":"Live Demo of Zero Touch Deployment","event_start":"2019-03-15 14:30:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 14:55:00","event_type":"EW: Networking: Software","description":"Live demo of installing NOS and orchestration agent on an OCP switch and live rollout of configuration of fully functional network with E-BGP, NAT, Load Balancer, ACLs.<br \/><br \/>","seats":"0","goers":"26","invite_only":"N","venue":"210 DH","id":"176dc6826b6a2a3296708479b26e0937","venue_id":"859649","speakers":"Alex Saroyan"},{"event_key":"238","active":"Y","name":"Xhaul Switch Specification","event_start":"2019-03-15 09:00:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 09:18:00","event_type":"EW: Telco & openEDGE","description":"New OCP specification of a xhaul Switch used in mobility network using merchant silicon.","seats":"0","goers":"25","invite_only":"N","venue":"212 CD","id":"1957dbe805a25a2f45f474e77ed6c535","venue_id":"851696","speakers":"Mike Meche"},{"event_key":"132","active":"Y","name":"Tools and Process for Creating a Redfish Profile","event_start":"2019-03-15 09:00:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 09:25:00","event_type":"EW: HW Management","description":"This session will describe the machine-readable document format for describing a Redfish Interoperability Profile, and will discuss the open source tools available to generate documentation and test systems for conformance.","seats":"0","goers":"31","invite_only":"N","venue":"Marriott Salon I&II","id":"19bfffbd2a9a6419b22406ce726850e7","venue_id":"859646","speakers":"Jeff Autor"},{"event_key":"360","active":"Y","name":"OCP Experience Lab","event_start":"2019-03-14 07:30:00","event_end":"2019-03-14 19:30:00","event_type":"Expo Hall","seats":"0","goers":"38","invite_only":"N","venue":"Lobby","id":"19e0f3595b6d4b0c9515d7afcd93f523","venue_id":"851654"},{"event_key":"232","active":"Y","name":"HW\/SW Co-design for Predictable IO Latency","event_start":"2019-03-15 15:00:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 15:18:00","event_type":"EW: Storage","description":"While the industry has been focusing on improving the IOPS & density of storage, the growth rate hasn\u2019t been the same for both across HDD\u2019s, Flash & SCM (storage class memory).

Thus, the ideal architecture is highly composable and able to transcend the specific configuration of physical server and storage infrastructures and instead deliver fully software defined, virtualized resources that provides as much compute, storage and networking as needed. Moreover, this flexibility must be provided in a way that is transparent to applications and provides agility, scalability, and secure isolation. This presentation will introduce a new SmartNIC technology that blurs the lines between local and remote NVMe Storage and makes all cloud resources be appear local.

Modular, purpose built enclosures are a great solution for data centers. Modular hybrid constructed buildings like CyrusOne and Microsoft, enterprise data systems, and telecom systems are all a perfect fit for modular, but not shipping containers.When building a modular data center, the walls are not the bulk of the cost, and should not be a limiting factor. It is true that containers are cheap and readily available, 80% of them are made in China to ship goods all over the world, and the Americas get a steady surplus of these metal boxes. To make them suitable for a data center (even a limited one with few racks) requires significant modification. Cleaning, repair, painting, insulating, door installation and more must be done to provide acceptable white space. These modifications are time consuming and costly, this quickly eats up the initial savings from that \"cheap\" shipping container. Purpose built modular data centers are the safest, most efficient, and most functional way to add capacity for any network. In this session, participants will learn the details of modular enclosures and limiting factors of ISO containers by looking at efficiencies, code requirements, and transportation costs.","seats":"0","goers":"16","invite_only":"N","venue":"211 AB","id":"2509bf612cd94390084454b1d9be4b2a","venue_id":"851669","speakers":"Rob Coyle"},{"event_key":"124","active":"Y","name":"Next Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors for Machine Learning","event_start":"2019-03-15 15:00:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 15:25:00","event_type":"EW: HPC & GPU\/FPGA Technology","description":"Intel is accelerating AI performance on Intel Xeon Scalable Processors with hardware features and software optimizations boosting performance across a wide range of AI\/DL\/ML workloads.

Current generation of NVMe SSDs provide significant performance at a lower latency. It is not uncommon to expect these devices providing million IOPS. In traditional deployments with NVMe SSDs directly attached to the processor, it is difficult to achieve balanced system configuration resulting in stranded flash performance and capacity. In disaggregated storage, flash is shared among pool of compute nodes using dynamic binding of storage resources based on performance, capacity requirements. However, carving out storage from the flash pool and exposing over network introduces latency. In this session we outline different network protocols, latency implications and industry trends to deliver low latency disaggregated flash storage over the network using OCP platforms.","seats":"0","goers":"77","invite_only":"N","venue":"212 AB","id":"2b00b95b628c0b6e760a3db8079c3c37","venue_id":"851693","speakers":"Anjaneya &quot;Reddy&quot; Chagam, Manoj Wadekar"},{"event_key":"136","active":"Y","name":"Manageability Security","event_start":"2019-03-15 14:00:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 14:25:00","event_type":"EW: HW Management","description":"A presentation on how to approach security for Management Hardware and Firmware.

Because of this, the kernel has had the infrastructure and the right abstractions to recognize and register a networking hardware device since the early days. And this infrastructure has matured over time. Today Linux enablement is the best way to get faster adoption of your hardware. And also possibly the fastest way to go-to-market. In this talk we look at Open switch hardware's journey into the Linux kernel, ecosystem and community. We will show how embracing Linux for your open switch hardware can simplify and unify your networking infrastructure. Linux kernel has abstractions for supporting switch hardware. We will talk about the support for switch hardware in the Linux kernel and walk through many cases of collaborative development in the Linux community that made this possible. In the recent years the Linux kernel has also received many networking updates to make it a first class network operating system for a data center switch hardware. These include VRF, MPLS, VxLAN, E-VPN and many others. We will cover details on these updates. Today one can build a open E-VPN data center fabric with open switch hardware, Linux kernel and other open software from the Linux ecosystem. How cool is that ?.

These benefits can in particular make high capacity QLC SSDs more attractive for the data center, cloud or edge infrastructure. However, compression inside SSDs is not widely available yet, and there is a lack of understanding of the implementation trade-offs and benefits. This talk will describe the implementation, interface and use cases for compression inside SSDs. The goal of this presentation is to add compression-enabled SSD devices to the Open Compute Project by defining hardware and software interfaces, workloads, and use cases.

Increasing proliferation of Artificial Intelligence, E-commerce, Internet-of-Things, Big Data and Cloud applications is leading to highly diversified workloads and usage cases. These applications can have drastically different I\/O patterns, and performance\/Quality-of-Service (QoS) targets. Traditional storage architecture is designed around standardized hardware that provides generic block I\/O interface, thus has the advantages of portability and backward compatibility. However, it is very challenging for the traditional storage architecture to meet the specific requirements with various usage models. To address this gap, Alibaba is focused on the development and deployment of open channel SSDs since from 2017. Open channel provides the capability of software\/hardware co-optimization and storage stack customization based on the applications. In this work, we present our progress towards the large scale deployment of open channel SSDs in hyper-scale data centers. We have defined the Alibaba Open channel (AOC) SSD spec, and built the open channel SSD platform with our industry partners. On top of this platform, we develop the multi-stream capability to achieve reduced write amplification and boosted performance with a simplified Flash-Translation-Layer implementation owing to the co-optimization with the application. We also develop the multiple physical partitions feature with open channel SSDs to achieve the very low read latency in mixed read\/write workload through the separation of read and write in search applications.","seats":"0","goers":"50","invite_only":"N","venue":"212 AB","id":"52e721183059c63a9d810aac800378ef","venue_id":"851693","speakers":"Feng Zhu"},{"event_key":"213","active":"Y","name":"SONiC+: Adding Application Logic to Open NOS","event_start":"2019-03-15 16:00:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 16:25:00","event_type":"EW: SONiC","description":"Now that SONiC is in production we should start enjoying the fruits of having an open Network OS.

Currently, when there is a link failure, it is a very tedious process to troubleshoot the optical interconnects with the existing tools. These troubleshoot tools are very expensive and can characterize one optical transceiver at a time. This is a very time consuming process and the operational cost is very high. To reduce the operational costs and to optimize the troubleshoot time, we have developed a unique tool called \u201cBER Illusion Methodology\u201d (BIM) which is based on OCP network switches. This methodology can be used to troubleshoot 128 optical interconnects simultaneously in less than 5 minutes including all necessary information such as Transmitter power, Transmitter bias current, Receiver power, Case Temperature, complete BER test, supplier details, etc. The number of troubleshoot ports can be scaled, just by adding more switches if needed in the topology. This endeavor describes a post production troubleshoot\/sustaining process which is being implemented to identify and characterize optical interconnect failures at our data centers so that we can reduce the \u201cNo Trouble Found (NTF)\u201d numbers significantly and with minimal effort.","seats":"0","goers":"55","invite_only":"N","venue":"211 CD","id":"54dcbf55f07059628a13d3e219dab2a4","venue_id":"851678","speakers":"Abhijit Chakravarty, Ashwin Poojary, Edward Galley"},{"event_key":"317","active":"Y","name":"Project Olympus 3U PCIe Expansion Server Deep Dive - Presented by ZT Systems","event_start":"2019-03-14 15:15:00","event_end":"2019-03-14 15:40:00","event_type":"Executive Track","description":"The Project Olympus building blocks provide an excellent foundation to develop and configure server solutions for specific server workloads (compute, cold storage, performance storage, and AI).

The company has created a Software Defined Fabric (SDF) that leverages open networking OCP-compliant white boxes from vendors including Accton and Delta Networks, among others, to reduce CAPEX. Automation features reduce OPEX and minimize time to deployment and configuration errors while the programmable capabilities of its fabric future-proofs network investments compared to slower, more costly merchant silicon product cycles. The fabric leverages OCP\u2019s Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) so that the installer can easily load the network OS across a variety of OCP-compliant switches, delivering greater choice and enabling operators to avoid vendor lock-in. Integrating vRouter, vSwitch, vGateway and other networking functions into a more streamlined data plane pathway enables data center operators to realize OCP\u2019s vision for highly efficient, low-cost operations with dramatically increased performance. By utilizing a container-based architecture and collapsing, or offloading, data plane functions from numerous VMs, a Software Defined Fabric architecture can deliver an increase of up to 2x in throughput with a 7x reduction in latency, improving overall networking efficiency by a factor of 5-10x. This speaker will examine new type of SDN-agnostic networking fabric controller for the OCP switch topology management of spine, leaf and controllers; including virtual fabric creation with resource allocation and modification to deliver virtual network fabric slicing; and utilizing external interfaces.

In 2017, Google contributed the Open Rack V2 48V spec to help the development of 48V rack and power components. In 2018 OCP, to further develop the 48V ecosystem, Google shared project \u201cFlatbed\u201d which is an adapter board and specifications to integrate 12V motherboards to a 48V rack. We also shared a new on-board 2-stage 48V to PoL voltage conversion approach to improve Total cost of ownership (TCO). For 2019 OCP, we like to present the toolkit to integrate AC-based chassis into 48V rack and new progress for on-board 48V power conversion. AC-12V based PSU to DC\/DC PDB Approach The OTS (Off The Shelf or enterprise) payloads are designed to take AC as input with the traditional 2 conversion UPS in the data center level, and it often requires certain hold up time (15ms to 20ms) and N+N redundancy to meet the availability target and repair process requirement. To optimize the power delivery system, many data center consumers have already moved to a centralized rack power delivery architecture which have the battery in the rack or tray level. The challenges of accommodating the OTS payloads into centralized rack power delivery system become very obvious because of the power architecture difference. In this workshop, we are going to show one approach to smoothly integrate the AC-based chassis OTS payloads into 48V centralized power system to meet a critical TTM target with a simple toolkit. This approach has been enabled by simplifying the power requirements in hold up time, redundancy, narrow input range, modularized design and so on. Onboard power In terms of 48V onboard power delivery, Google has been continuously driving the technologies toward higher efficiency, higher density, better scalability and cost effectiveness to meet the rapidly increasing data center computing power demand. Our technologies address a variety of use cases across server, storage, networking and AI accelerators. Significant progress has been made in these specific applications: 1. multi-phase 48V-to-12V voltage regulators adopting the latest hybrid switched-capacitor-buck topologies for traditional 12V workloads such as PCIEs and OTS servers; 2. very high efficiency high density fixed ratio bus converters for 2-stage 48V-to-PoL power conversions; 3. high frequency high density voltage regulators for extremely power hungry AI accelerators. A complete onboard 48V power solution portfolio is explored in this workshop.","seats":"0","goers":"113","invite_only":"N","venue":"210 BF","id":"ab16d6a24c4a6d97d44156f8a513e20c","venue_id":"851687","speakers":"Xin Li, Shuai Jiang"},{"event_key":"324","active":"Y","name":"Open19 Technology - Presented by LinkedIn","event_start":"2019-03-15 15:30:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 15:45:00","event_type":"Expo Hall Talk","description":"The Open19 platform is the next generation technology of choice for data center and Edge for modular modernized data center infrastructure and server build outs.

In December 2017, it was reported that data centers consume about 416 terawatts globally (Forbes) and, with the explosion in cloud computing, the figure is surely higher now and set to increase dramatically. Small percentage savings are therefore valuable in terms of cost reduction and reduced environmental impact. Today\u2019s power distribution architectures typically convert either AC or 48V DC to an isolated 12V, which is routed around server racks with non-isolated point-of-load converters providing the final step-down in voltage. As the rack loading has ramped up, however, the current at 12V has become increasingly unmanageable, causing significant ohmic distribution losses. Dual conversion of 48V to 12V, then 12V to load voltage, has also been a source of losses, even with end-to-end efficiencies of about 89%. A solution already adopted by Google and Facebook in their standard Open Rack v2.0 is to eliminate the 12V bus for the very highest current demands and convert 48V directly to the load voltage \u2013 the Direct Conversion approach. In this arrangement, 48V is distributed directly to the server blades, and an isolated converter on the board close to the load provides precise regulation where it is needed. This approach had been adopted in the past, when end voltages were typically 5V or 3.3V, but the conversion technology of the day was too inefficient at voltages lower than these. Technology has now advanced, to the point where an isolated 48V to 1V converter can be more than 92% efficient: a 2% to 3% gain over the IBA approach. Benefits are wide-ranging: current at 48V is a quarter of the 12V value for the same power, yielding a sixteenth of the losses in comparable cabling and bus connections; overall footprint is smaller, with a single conversion stage, and hardware costs lower; cooling requirements are reduced, and energy saved with a more efficient process. The modern design of the new Direct Conversion DC-DCs also facilitates extra functionality such as Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) for optimal processor speed and energy draw, and a serial voltage ID interface. Full digital control of the converters is typical, with programmability through an I2C PMBus interface. The first products from Flex Power Modules, based around ST microcontrollers, provide a modular multi-phase solution. There is a 70A \u201cmain\u201d unit with a footprint of 28mm x 12mm, while up to five additional 70A \u201csatellites\u201d in the same footprint can be added as needed, up to 420A in total. This approach offers efficiency optimization across a wide range of current demands, with the addition of automatic phase addition and removal where demanded by the load. With a 1.0V output, a nearly flat efficiency of 92% is provided across most of the load curve. Even with all the advantages Direct Conversion affords, the marketplace insists on having a broad base of suppliers. To that end, Flex Power Modules is expanding the 48V ecosystem for Direct Conversion. Now that Flex Power Modules has introduced products, and continues with a product roadmap, the ecosystem is here and growing. Flex is one of the founders of an industry alliance, the Power Stamp Alliance (PSA), further promoting the expansion of the 48V ecosystem. The PSA is a collaboration between founding members Flex Power Modules, Artesyn Embedded Technologies, Bel Power Solutions and STMicroelectronics to offer Direct Conversion products. It sets functional and mechanical standards for these new Direct Conversion products, with each member free to set the topology utilized and detail design. This presentation will highlight the key technical features and benefits of the 48V Direct Conversion approach in OCP platforms, as well as highlighting the commercial benefits of an open alliance such as the PSA.","seats":"0","goers":"32","invite_only":"N","venue":"210 BF","id":"c0b90c293c4f65f019500db11becf270","venue_id":"851687","speakers":"Bob Cantrell"},{"event_key":"355","active":"Y","name":"OCP Impact Study 2019: Market Place Matures, Adoption Increases","event_start":"2019-03-14 13:00:00","event_end":"2019-03-14 13:25:00","event_type":"Executive Track","description":"At the close of 2018, we conducted a follow on to our 2018 survey of top OCP vendors and end users.<br>Combined with IHS Markit\u2019s continual industry research, we determine growth of 2018 non-board<br>member adoption over 2017.

The disaggregation of hardware and software and the open sourcing of both, pioneered by OCP, has inspired the telecom industry to break out of its chains and adopt white boxes for servers, switches, various appliances, and the new Universal CPE as platforms for VNFs that eliminate the service specificity of the hardware. And as more telecom services, orchestration, and management are conducted in data-center environments, thanks to SDN and NFV, the OCP model becomes the one to emulate. In this talk we will describe some examples of working proofs of concept shown recently by MEF members and partners of white boxes and open-source or proprietary software to enable new, agile services and capabilities.","seats":"0","goers":"52","invite_only":"N","venue":"211 CD","id":"da18bac3c4b33d25c97a0dd76e905670","venue_id":"851678","speakers":"Dan Pitt"},{"event_key":"221","active":"Y","name":"An Update on the New SNIA Computational Storage Technical Work Group: Contributing to Industry Understanding and Use of This New Paradigm of Computer Architecture","event_start":"2019-03-15 08:20:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 08:38:00","event_type":"EW: Storage","description":"The industry is seeing an increase in customer requirements to move compute closer to traditional storage devices and systems.

Not only is the explosion of data overwhelming the compute capacity of traditional CPU-based clusters, but also the lesser known slowing of Koomey\u2019s Law leads to decreased power efficiency over time. Xilinx and its partners are revolutionizing the data center by providing adaptable, high performance and power efficient solutions for compute, storage and network acceleration. In this presentation, we will highlight available and deployable solutions for the data center, both in the cloud and on premises, enabled by the Xilinx Alveo portfolio of acceleration cards as well as our growing ecosystem of hardware and software partners.","seats":"0","goers":"99","invite_only":"N","venue":"210 DH","id":"ff8807a59cb4faa140eea13b830a9dbf","venue_id":"859649","speakers":"Manish Muthal, Ravi Sunkavalli"},{"event_key":"233","active":"Y","name":"HDD IOPS : The Never Ending Story","event_start":"2019-03-15 15:20:00","event_end":"2019-03-15 15:38:00","event_type":"EW: Storage","description":"In the never-ending search for higher density, hard disk drives have continued to create a widening performance gap in IOPS\/TB. Over time software has evolved to compensate for this by optimizing hot and cool data distribution, as well as multiple layers of caching. With SSDs continuing to reduce in price, how can HDDs improve and be effectively used to bridge the performance gap? Multi-Actuator drives are on their way, and their introduction will require us to consider the impact to our storage platforms and the TCO models to see if they make sense. With higher performance comes higher power and thermal challenges.","seats":"0","goers":"52","invite_only":"N","venue":"212 AB","id":"ffab56321216b02f5f6784863f97f6bf","venue_id":"851693","speakers":"Jason Adrian"}]
